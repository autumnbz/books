for each of the standard alphabetic escape sequences (5.2.2).</cite>

     <li><cite>The value of a </cite><code>char</code><cite> object into which has been stored any
character other than a member of the basic execution character set (6.2.5).</cite>

     <li><cite>Which of </cite><code>signed char</code><cite> or </cite><code>unsigned char</code><cite> has the same range,
representation, and behavior as "plain" </cite><code>char</code><cite> (6.2.5, 6.3.1.1).</cite>

     <li><cite>The mapping of members of the source character set (in character
constants and string literals) to members of the execution character
set (6.4.4.4, 5.1.1.2).</cite>

     <li><cite>The value of an integer character constant containing more than one
character or containing a character or escape sequence that does not map
to a single-byte execution character (6.4.4.4).</cite>

     <li><cite>The value of a wide character constant containing more than one
multibyte character, or containing a multibyte character or escape
sequence not represented in the extended execution character set (6.4.4.4).</cite>

     <li><cite>The current locale used to convert a wide character constant consisting
of a single multibyte character that maps to a member of the extended
execution character set into a corresponding wide character code (6.4.4.4).</cite>

corresponding wide character codes (6.4.5).</cite>

sequence not represented in the execution character set (6.4.5).</cite>
