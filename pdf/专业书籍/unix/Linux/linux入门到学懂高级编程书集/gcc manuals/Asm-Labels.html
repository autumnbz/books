<h3 class="section">Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code</h3>

<p>You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the <code>asm</code> (or <code>__asm__</code>)
keyword after the declarator as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;
     </pre>

<p>This specifies that the name to be used for the variable <code>foo</code> in
the assembler code should be <code>myfoo</code> rather than the usual
<code>_foo</code>.

   <p>On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of a C
function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for the
linker that do not start with an underscore.

   <p>It does not make sense to use this feature with a non-static local
variable since such variables do not have assembler names.  If you are
trying to put the variable in a particular register, see <a href="Explicit-Reg-Vars.html#Explicit%20Reg%20Vars">Explicit Reg Vars</a>.  GCC presently accepts such code with a warning, but will
probably be changed to issue an error, rather than a warning, in the
future.

   <p>You cannot use <code>asm</code> in this way in a function <em>definition</em>; but
you can get the same effect by writing a declaration for the function
before its definition and putting <code>asm</code> there, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     extern func () asm ("FUNC");
     
     func (x, y)
          int x, y;
     /* <small class="dots">...</small> */
     </pre>

   <p>It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do not
conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.  GCC
does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in registers. 
Perhaps that will be added.
