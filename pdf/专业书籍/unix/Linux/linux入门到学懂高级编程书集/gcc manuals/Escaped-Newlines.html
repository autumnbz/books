<h3 class="section">Slightly Looser Rules for Escaped Newlines</h3>

<p>Recently, the preprocessor has relaxed its treatment of escaped
newlines.  Previously, the newline had to immediately follow a
backslash.  The current implementation allows whitespace in the form
of spaces, horizontal and vertical tabs, and form feeds between the
backslash and the subsequent newline.  The preprocessor issues a
warning, but treats it as a valid escaped newline and combines the two
lines to form a single logical line.  This works within comments and
tokens, as well as between tokens.  Comments are <em>not</em> treated as
whitespace for the purposes of this relaxation, since they have not
yet been replaced with spaces.
