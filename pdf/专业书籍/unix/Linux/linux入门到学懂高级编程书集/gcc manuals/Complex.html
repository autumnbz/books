<h3 class="section">Complex Numbers</h3>

<p>ISO C99 supports complex floating data types, and as an extension GCC
supports them in C89 mode and in C++, and supports complex integer data
types which are not part of ISO C99.  You can declare complex types
using the keyword <code>_Complex</code>.  As an extension, the older GNU
keyword <code>__complex__</code> is also supported.

   <p>For example, <code>_Complex double x;</code> declares <code>x</code> as a
variable whose real part and imaginary part are both of type
<code>double</code>.  <code>_Complex short int y;</code> declares <code>y</code> to
have real and imaginary parts of type <code>short int</code>; this is not
likely to be useful, but it shows that the set of complex types is
complete.

   <p>To write a constant with a complex data type, use the suffix <code>i</code> or
<code>j</code> (either one; they are equivalent).  For example, <code>2.5fi</code>
has type <code>_Complex float</code> and <code>3i</code> has type
<code>_Complex int</code>.  Such a constant always has a pure imaginary
value, but you can form any complex value you like by adding one to a
real constant.  This is a GNU extension; if you have an ISO C99
conforming C library (such as GNU libc), and want to construct complex
constants of floating type, you should include <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> and
use the macros <code>I</code> or <code>_Complex_I</code> instead.

   <p>To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression <var>exp</var>, write
<code>__real__ </code><var>exp</var><code></code>.  Likewise, use <code>__imag__</code> to
extract the imaginary part.  This is a GNU extension; for values of
floating type, you should use the ISO C99 functions <code>crealf</code>,
<code>creal</code>, <code>creall</code>, <code>cimagf</code>, <code>cimag</code> and
<code>cimagl</code>, declared in <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> and also provided as
built-in functions by GCC.

   <p>The operator <code>~</code> performs complex conjugation when used on a value
with a complex type.  This is a GNU extension; for values of
floating type, you should use the ISO C99 functions <code>conjf</code>,
<code>conj</code> and <code>conjl</code>, declared in <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> and also
provided as built-in functions by GCC.

   <p>GCC can allocate complex automatic variables in a noncontiguous
fashion; it's even possible for the real part to be in a register while
the imaginary part is on the stack (or vice-versa).  Only the DWARF2
debug info format can represent this, so use of DWARF2 is recommended. 
If you are using the stabs debug info format, GCC describes a noncontiguous
complex variable as if it were two separate variables of noncomplex type. 
If the variable's actual name is <code>foo</code>, the two fictitious
variables are named <code>foo$real</code> and <code>foo$imag</code>.  You can
examine and set these two fictitious variables with your debugger.
