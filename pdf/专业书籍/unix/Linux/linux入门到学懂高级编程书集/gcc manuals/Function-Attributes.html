<h3 class="section">Declaring Attributes of Functions</h3>

<p>In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your program
which help the compiler optimize function calls and check your code more
carefully.

   <p>The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes when making a declaration.  This keyword is followed by an
attribute specification inside double parentheses.  The following
attributes are currently defined for functions on all targets:
<code>noreturn</code>, <code>noinline</code>, <code>always_inline</code>,
<code>pure</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>nothrow</code>,
<code>format</code>, <code>format_arg</code>, <code>no_instrument_function</code>,
<code>section</code>, <code>constructor</code>, <code>destructor</code>, <code>used</code>,
<code>unused</code>, <code>deprecated</code>, <code>weak</code>, <code>malloc</code>,
<code>alias</code>, <code>warn_unused_result</code> and <code>nonnull</code>.  Several other
attributes are defined for functions on particular target systems.  Other
attributes, including <code>section</code> are supported for variables declarations
(see <a href="Variable-Attributes.html#Variable%20Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>) and for types (see <a href="Type-Attributes.html#Type%20Attributes">Type Attributes</a>).

   <p>You may also specify attributes with <code>__</code> preceding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use <code>__noreturn__</code> instead of <code>noreturn</code>.

   <p>See <a href="Attribute-Syntax.html#Attribute%20Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.

     <dl>
<dt><code>noreturn</code>
     <dd>A few standard library functions, such as <code>abort</code> and <code>exit</code>,
cannot return.  GCC knows this automatically.  Some programs define
their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
<code>noreturn</code> to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));
          
          void
          fatal (/* <small class="dots">...</small> */)
          {
            /* <small class="dots">...</small> */ /* Print error message. */ /* <small class="dots">...</small> */
            exit (1);
          }
          </pre>

     <p>The <code>noreturn</code> keyword tells the compiler to assume that
<code>fatal</code> cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what
would happen if <code>fatal</code> ever did return.  This makes slightly
better code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
uninitialized variables.

     <p>The <code>noreturn</code> keyword does not affect the exceptional path when that
applies: a <code>noreturn</code>-marked function may still return to the caller
by throwing an exception.

     <p>Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
restored before calling the <code>noreturn</code> function.

     <p>It does not make sense for a <code>noreturn</code> function to have a return
type other than <code>void</code>.

     <p>The attribute <code>noreturn</code> is not implemented in GCC versions
earlier than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function does
not return, which works in the current version and in some older
versions, is as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef void voidfn ();
          
          volatile voidfn fatal;
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>noinline</code>
     <dd>This function attribute prevents a function from being considered for
inlining.

     <br><dt><code>always_inline</code>
     <dd>Generally, functions are not inlined unless optimization is specified. 
For functions declared inline, this attribute inlines the function even
if no optimization level was specified.

     <br><dt><code>pure</code>
     <dd>Many functions have no effects except the return value and their
return value depends only on the parameters and/or global variables. 
Such a function can be subject
to common subexpression elimination and loop optimization just as an
arithmetic operator would be.  These functions should be declared
with the attribute <code>pure</code>.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          int square (int) __attribute__ ((pure));
          </pre>

     <p>says that the hypothetical function <code>square</code> is safe to call
fewer times than the program says.

     <p>Some of common examples of pure functions are <code>strlen</code> or <code>memcmp</code>. 
Interesting non-pure functions are functions with infinite loops or those
depending on volatile memory or other system resource, that may change between
two consecutive calls (such as <code>feof</code> in a multithreading environment).

     <p>The attribute <code>pure</code> is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
than 2.96. 
<br><dt><code>const</code>
     <dd>Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments, and
have no effects except the return value.  Basically this is just slightly
more strict class than the <code>pure</code> attribute above, since function is not
allowed to read global memory.

     <p>Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the data
pointed to must <em>not</em> be declared <code>const</code>.  Likewise, a
function that calls a non-<code>const</code> function usually must not be
<code>const</code>.  It does not make sense for a <code>const</code> function to
return <code>void</code>.

     <p>The attribute <code>const</code> is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function has no side
effects, which works in the current version and in some older versions,
is as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int intfn ();
          
          extern const intfn square;
          </pre>

     <p>This approach does not work in GNU C++ from 2.6.0 on, since the language
specifies that the <code>const</code> must be attached to the return value.

     <br><dt><code>nothrow</code>
     <dd>The <code>nothrow</code> attribute is used to inform the compiler that a
function cannot throw an exception.  For example, most functions in
the standard C library can be guaranteed not to throw an exception
with the notable exceptions of <code>qsort</code> and <code>bsearch</code> that
take function pointer arguments.  The <code>nothrow</code> attribute is not
implemented in GCC versions earlier than 3.2.

     <br><dt><code>format (</code><var>archetype</var><code>, </code><var>string-index</var><code>, </code><var>first-to-check</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>The <code>format</code> attribute specifies that a function takes <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> style arguments which
should be type-checked against a format string.  For example, the
declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern int
          my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
                __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));
          </pre>

     <p>causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to <code>my_printf</code>
for consistency with the <code>printf</code> style format string argument
<code>my_format</code>.

     <p>The parameter <var>archetype</var> determines how the format string is
interpreted, and should be <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code>
or <code>strfmon</code>.  (You can also use <code>__printf__</code>,
<code>__scanf__</code>, <code>__strftime__</code> or <code>__strfmon__</code>.)  The
parameter <var>string-index</var> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from 1), while <var>first-to-check</var> is the
number of the first argument to check against the format string.  For
functions where the arguments are not available to be checked (such as
<code>vprintf</code>), specify the third parameter as zero.  In this case the
compiler only checks the format string for consistency.  For
<code>strftime</code> formats, the third parameter is required to be zero. 
Since non-static C++ methods have an implicit <code>this</code> argument, the
arguments of such methods should be counted from two, not one, when
giving values for <var>string-index</var> and <var>first-to-check</var>.

     <p>In the example above, the format string (<code>my_format</code>) is the second
argument of the function <code>my_print</code>, and the arguments to check
start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the format
attribute are 2 and 3.

     <p>The <code>format</code> attribute allows you to identify your own functions
which take format strings as arguments, so that GCC can check the
calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always (unless
<code>-ffreestanding</code> is used) checks formats
for the standard library functions <code>printf</code>, <code>fprintf</code>,
<code>sprintf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>fscanf</code>, <code>sscanf</code>, <code>strftime</code>,
<code>vprintf</code>, <code>vfprintf</code> and <code>vsprintf</code> whenever such
warnings are requested (using <code>-Wformat</code>), so there is no need to
modify the header file <code>stdio.h</code>.  In C99 mode, the functions
<code>snprintf</code>, <code>vsnprintf</code>, <code>vscanf</code>, <code>vfscanf</code> and
<code>vsscanf</code> are also checked.  Except in strictly conforming C
standard modes, the X/Open function <code>strfmon</code> is also checked as
are <code>printf_unlocked</code> and <code>fprintf_unlocked</code>. 
See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C%20Dialect%20Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

     <br><dt><code>format_arg (</code><var>string-index</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>The <code>format_arg</code> attribute specifies that a function takes a format
string for a <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or
<code>strfmon</code> style function and modifies it (for example, to translate
it into another language), so the result can be passed to a
<code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> style
function (with the remaining arguments to the format function the same
as they would have been for the unmodified string).  For example, the
declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern char *
          my_dgettext (char *my_domain, const char *my_format)
                __attribute__ ((format_arg (2)));
          </pre>

     <p>causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to a <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> type function, whose
format string argument is a call to the <code>my_dgettext</code> function, for
consistency with the format string argument <code>my_format</code>.  If the
<code>format_arg</code> attribute had not been specified, all the compiler
could tell in such calls to format functions would be that the format
string argument is not constant; this would generate a warning when
<code>-Wformat-nonliteral</code> is used, but the calls could not be checked
without the attribute.

     <p>The parameter <var>string-index</var> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from one).  Since non-static C++ methods have
an implicit <code>this</code> argument, the arguments of such methods should
be counted from two.

     <p>The <code>format-arg</code> attribute allows you to identify your own
functions which modify format strings, so that GCC can check the
calls to <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code>
type function whose operands are a call to one of your own function. 
The compiler always treats <code>gettext</code>, <code>dgettext</code>, and
<code>dcgettext</code> in this manner except when strict ISO C support is
requested by <code>-ansi</code> or an appropriate <code>-std</code> option, or
<code>-ffreestanding</code> is used.  See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C%20Dialect%20Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

     <br><dt><code>nonnull (</code><var>arg-index</var><code>, ...)</code>
     <dd>The <code>nonnull</code> attribute specifies that some function parameters should
be non-null pointers.  For instance, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
          	__attribute__((nonnull (1, 2)));
          </pre>

     <p>causes the compiler to check that, in calls to <code>my_memcpy</code>,
arguments <var>dest</var> and <var>src</var> are non-null.  If the compiler
determines that a null pointer is passed in an argument slot marked
as non-null, and the <code>-Wnonnull</code> option is enabled, a warning
is issued.  The compiler may also choose to make optimizations based
on the knowledge that certain function arguments will not be null.

     <p>If no argument index list is given to the <code>nonnull</code> attribute,
all pointer arguments are marked as non-null.  To illustrate, the
following declaration is equivalent to the previous example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
          	__attribute__((nonnull));
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>no_instrument_function</code>
     <dd>If <code>-finstrument-functions</code> is given, profiling function calls will
be generated at entry and exit of most user-compiled functions. 
Functions with this attribute will not be so instrumented.

     <br><dt><code>section ("</code><var>section-name</var><code>")</code>
     <dd>Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the <code>text</code> section. 
Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you need certain
particular functions to appear in special sections.  The <code>section</code>
attribute specifies that a function lives in a particular section. 
For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section ("bar")));
          </pre>

     <p>puts the function <code>foobar</code> in the <code>bar</code> section.

     <p>Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <code>section</code>
attribute is not available on all platforms. 
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

     <br><dt><code>constructor</code>
     <dd><dt><code>destructor</code>
     <dd>The <code>constructor</code> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically before execution enters <code>main ()</code>.  Similarly, the
<code>destructor</code> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically after <code>main ()</code> has completed or <code>exit ()</code> has
been called.  Functions with these attributes are useful for
initializing data that will be used implicitly during the execution of
the program.

     <p>These attributes are not currently implemented for Objective-C.

     <br><dt><code>unused</code>
     <dd>This attribute, attached to a function, means that the function is meant
to be possibly unused.  GCC will not produce a warning for this
function.

     <br><dt><code>used</code>
     <dd>This attribute, attached to a function, means that code must be emitted
for the function even if it appears that the function is not referenced. 
This is useful, for example, when the function is referenced only in
inline assembly.

     <br><dt><code>deprecated</code>
     <dd>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute results in a warning if the function
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
functions that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated function, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the function is deprecated, or what they should
do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int old_fn () __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          int old_fn ();
          int (*fn_ptr)() = old_fn;
          </pre>

     <p>results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.

     <p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute can also be used for variables and
types (see <a href="Variable-Attributes.html#Variable%20Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>, see <a href="Type-Attributes.html#Type%20Attributes">Type Attributes</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>warn_unused_result</code>
     <dd>The <code>warn_unused_result</code> attribute causes a warning to be emitted
if a caller of the function with this attribute does not use its
return value.  This is useful for functions where not checking
the result is either a security problem or always a bug, such as
<code>realloc</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          int fn () __attribute__ ((warn_unused_result));
          int foo ()
          {
            if (fn () &lt; 0) return -1;
            fn ();
            return 0;
          }
          </pre>

     <p>results in warning on line 5.

     <br><dt><code>weak</code>
     <dd>The <code>weak</code> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as a weak
symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily useful in defining
library functions which can be overridden in user code, though it can
also be used with non-function declarations.  Weak symbols are supported
for ELF targets, and also for a.out targets when using the GNU assembler
and linker.

     <br><dt><code>malloc</code>
     <dd>The <code>malloc</code> attribute is used to tell the compiler that a function
may be treated as if any non-<code>NULL</code> pointer it returns cannot
alias any other pointer valid when the function returns. 
This will often improve optimization. 
Standard functions with this property include <code>malloc</code> and
<code>calloc</code>.  <code>realloc</code>-like functions have this property as
long as the old pointer is never referred to (including comparing it
to the new pointer) after the function returns a non-<code>NULL</code>
value.

     <br><dt><code>alias ("</code><var>target</var><code>")</code>
     <dd>The <code>alias</code> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an
alias for another symbol, which must be specified.  For instance,

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __f () { /* Do something. */; }
          void f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("__f")));
          </pre>

     <p>declares <code>f</code> to be a weak alias for <code>__f</code>.  In C++, the
mangled name for the target must be used.

     <p>Not all target machines support this attribute.

     <br><dt><code>visibility ("</code><var>visibility_type</var><code>")</code>
     <dd>The <code>visibility</code> attribute on ELF targets causes the declaration
to be emitted with default, hidden, protected or internal visibility.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __attribute__ ((visibility ("protected")))
          f () { /* Do something. */; }
          int i __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")));
          </pre>

     <p>See the ELF gABI for complete details, but the short story is:

          <dl>
<dt><dfn>default</dfn>
          <dd>Default visibility is the normal case for ELF.  This value is
available for the visibility attribute to override other options
that may change the assumed visibility of symbols.

          <br><dt><dfn>hidden</dfn>
          <dd>Hidden visibility indicates that the symbol will not be placed into
the dynamic symbol table, so no other <dfn>module</dfn> (executable or
shared library) can reference it directly.

          <br><dt><dfn>protected</dfn>
          <dd>Protected visibility indicates that the symbol will be placed in the
dynamic symbol table, but that references within the defining module
will bind to the local symbol.  That is, the symbol cannot be overridden
by another module.

          <br><dt><dfn>internal</dfn>
          <dd>Internal visibility is like hidden visibility, but with additional
processor specific semantics.  Unless otherwise specified by the psABI,
GCC defines internal visibility to mean that the function is <em>never</em>
called from another module.  Note that hidden symbols, while they cannot
be referenced directly by other modules, can be referenced indirectly via
function pointers.  By indicating that a symbol cannot be called from
outside the module, GCC may for instance omit the load of a PIC register
since it is known that the calling function loaded the correct value. 
</dl>

     <p>Not all ELF targets support this attribute.

     <br><dt><code>regparm (</code><var>number</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>On the Intel 386, the <code>regparm</code> attribute causes the compiler to
pass up to <var>number</var> integer arguments in registers EAX,
EDX, and ECX instead of on the stack.  Functions that take a
variable number of arguments will continue to be passed all of their
arguments on the stack.

     <p>Beware that on some ELF systems this attribute is unsuitable for
global functions in shared libraries with lazy binding (which is the
default).  Lazy binding will send the first call via resolving code in
the loader, which might assume EAX, EDX and ECX can be clobbered, as
per the standard calling conventions.  Solaris 8 is affected by this. 
GNU systems with GLIBC 2.1 or higher, and FreeBSD, are believed to be
safe since the loaders there save all registers.  (Lazy binding can be
disabled with the linker or the loader if desired, to avoid the
problem.)

     <br><dt><code>stdcall</code>
     <dd>On the Intel 386, the <code>stdcall</code> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the called function will pop off the stack space used to
pass arguments, unless it takes a variable number of arguments.

     <br><dt><code>fastcall</code>
     <dd>On the Intel 386, the <code>fastcall</code> attribute causes the compiler to
pass the first two arguments in the registers ECX and EDX. Subsequent
arguments are passed on the stack. The called function will pop the
arguments off the stack. If the number of arguments is variable all
arguments are pushed on the stack.

     <br><dt><code>cdecl</code>
     <dd>On the Intel 386, the <code>cdecl</code> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the calling function will pop off the stack space used to
pass arguments.  This is
useful to override the effects of the <code>-mrtd</code> switch.

     <br><dt><code>longcall/shortcall</code>
     <dd>On the RS/6000 and PowerPC, the <code>longcall</code> attribute causes the
compiler to always call this function via a pointer, just as it would if
the <code>-mlongcall</code> option had been specified.  The <code>shortcall</code>
attribute causes the compiler not to do this.  These attributes override
both the <code>-mlongcall</code> switch and the <code>#pragma longcall</code>
setting.

     <p>See <a href="RS-6000-and-PowerPC-Options.html#RS%2f6000%20and%20PowerPC%20Options">RS/6000 and PowerPC Options</a>, for more information on whether long
calls are necessary.

     <br><dt><code>long_call/short_call</code>
     <dd>This attribute specifies how a particular function is called on
ARM.  Both attributes override the <code>-mlong-calls</code> (see <a href="ARM-Options.html#ARM%20Options">ARM Options</a>)
command line switch and <code>#pragma long_calls</code> settings.  The
<code>long_call</code> attribute causes the compiler to always call the
function by first loading its address into a register and then using the
contents of that register.   The <code>short_call</code> attribute always places
the offset to the function from the call site into the <code>BL</code>
instruction directly.

     <br><dt><code>function_vector</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that the specified
function should be called through the function vector.  Calling a
function through the function vector will reduce code size, however;
the function vector has a limited size (maximum 128 entries on the H8/300
and 64 entries on the H8/300H and H8S) and shares space with the interrupt vector.

     <p>You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this attribute to work correctly.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the ARM, AVR, C4x, M32R/D and Xstormy16 ports to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will
generate function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an
interrupt handler when this attribute is present.

     <p>Note, interrupt handlers for the m68k, H8/300, H8/300H, H8S, and SH processors
can be specified via the <code>interrupt_handler</code> attribute.

     <p>Note, on the AVR, interrupts will be enabled inside the function.

     <p>Note, for the ARM, you can specify the kind of interrupt to be handled by
adding an optional parameter to the interrupt attribute like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt ("IRQ")));
          </pre>

     <p>Permissible values for this parameter are: IRQ, FIQ, SWI, ABORT and UNDEF.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt_handler</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the m68k, H8/300, H8/300H, H8S, and SH to indicate that
the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will generate
function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt
handler when this attribute is present.

     <br><dt><code>sp_switch</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the SH to indicate an <code>interrupt_handler</code>
function should switch to an alternate stack.  It expects a string
argument that names a global variable holding the address of the
alternate stack.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void *alt_stack;
          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt_handler,
                                    sp_switch ("alt_stack")));
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>trap_exit</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the SH for an <code>interrupt_handler</code> to return using
<code>trapa</code> instead of <code>rte</code>.  This attribute expects an integer
argument specifying the trap number to be used.

     <br><dt><code>eightbit_data</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that the specified
variable should be placed into the eight bit data section. 
The compiler will generate more efficient code for certain operations
on data in the eight bit data area.  Note the eight bit data area is limited to
256 bytes of data.

     <p>You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this attribute to work correctly.

     <br><dt><code>tiny_data</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the H8/300H and H8S to indicate that the specified
variable should be placed into the tiny data section. 
The compiler will generate more efficient code for loads and stores
on data in the tiny data section.  Note the tiny data area is limited to
slightly under 32kbytes of data.

     <br><dt><code>saveall</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H, and H8S to indicate that
all registers except the stack pointer should be saved in the prologue
regardless of whether they are used or not.

     <br><dt><code>signal</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the AVR to indicate that the specified
function is a signal handler.  The compiler will generate function
entry and exit sequences suitable for use in a signal handler when this
attribute is present.  Interrupts will be disabled inside the function.

     <br><dt><code>naked</code>
     <dd>Use this attribute on the ARM, AVR, C4x and IP2K ports to indicate that the
specified function does not need prologue/epilogue sequences generated by
the compiler.  It is up to the programmer to provide these sequences.

     <br><dt><code>model (</code><var>model-name</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>

     <p>On the M32R/D, use this attribute to set the addressability of an
object, and of the code generated for a function.  The identifier
<var>model-name</var> is one of <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>, or
<code>large</code>, representing each of the code models.

     <p>Small model objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
addresses can be loaded with the <code>ld24</code> instruction), and are
callable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

     <p>Medium model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
compiler will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses),
and are callable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

     <p>Large model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
compiler will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses),
and may not be reachable with the <code>bl</code> instruction (the compiler will
generate the much slower <code>seth/add3/jl</code> instruction sequence).

     <p>On IA-64, use this attribute to set the addressability of an object. 
At present, the only supported identifier for <var>model-name</var> is
<code>small</code>, indicating addressability via "small" (22-bit)
addresses (so that their addresses can be loaded with the <code>addl</code>
instruction).  Caveat: such addressing is by definition not position
independent and hence this attribute must not be used for objects
defined by shared libraries.

     <br><dt><code>far</code>
     <dd>On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the <code>far</code> attribute causes the compiler to
use a calling convention that takes care of switching memory banks when
entering and leaving a function.  This calling convention is also the
default when using the <code>-mlong-calls</code> option.

     <p>On 68HC12 the compiler will use the <code>call</code> and <code>rtc</code> instructions
to call and return from a function.

     <p>On 68HC11 the compiler will generate a sequence of instructions
to invoke a board-specific routine to switch the memory bank and call the
real function. The board-specific routine simulates a <code>call</code>. 
At the end of a function, it will jump to a board-specific routine
instead of using <code>rts</code>. The board-specific return routine simulates
the <code>rtc</code>.

     <br><dt><code>near</code>
     <dd>On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the <code>near</code> attribute causes the compiler to
use the normal calling convention based on <code>jsr</code> and <code>rts</code>. 
This attribute can be used to cancel the effect of the <code>-mlong-calls</code>
option.

     <br><dt><code>dllimport</code>
     <dd>On Microsoft Windows targets, the <code>dllimport</code> attribute causes the compiler
to reference a function or variable via a global pointer to a pointer
that is set up by the Microsoft Windows dll library. The pointer name is formed by
combining <code>_imp__</code> and the function or variable name. The attribute
implies <code>extern</code> storage.

     <p>Currently, the attribute is ignored for inlined functions. If the
attribute is applied to a symbol <em>definition</em>, an error is reported. 
If a symbol previously declared <code>dllimport</code> is later defined, the
attribute is ignored in subsequent references, and a warning is emitted. 
The attribute is also overridden by a subsequent declaration as
<code>dllexport</code>.

     <p>When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks non-inlined
member functions and static data members as imports.  However, the
attribute is ignored for virtual methods to allow creation of vtables
using thunks.

     <p>On cygwin, mingw and arm-pe targets, <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code> is
recognized as a synonym for <code>__attribute__ ((dllimport))</code> for
compatibility with other Microsoft Windows compilers.

     <p>The use of the <code>dllimport</code> attribute on functions is not necessary,
but provides a small performance benefit by eliminating a thunk in the
dll. The use of the <code>dllimport</code> attribute on imported variables was
required on older versions of GNU ld, but can now be avoided by passing
the <code>--enable-auto-import</code> switch to ld. As with functions, using
the attribute for a variable eliminates a thunk in the dll.

     <p>One drawback to using this attribute is that a pointer to a function or
variable marked as dllimport cannot be used as a constant address. The
attribute can be disabled for functions by setting the
<code>-mnop-fun-dllimport</code> flag.

     <br><dt><code>dllexport</code>
     <dd>On Microsoft Windows targets the <code>dllexport</code> attribute causes the compiler to
provide a global pointer to a pointer in a dll, so that it can be
referenced with the <code>dllimport</code> attribute. The pointer name is
formed by combining <code>_imp__</code> and the function or variable name.

     <p>Currently, the <code>dllexport</code>attribute is ignored for inlined
functions, but export can be forced by using the
<code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code> flag. The attribute is also ignored for
undefined symbols.

     <p>When applied to C++ classes. the attribute marks defined non-inlined
member functions and static data members as exports. Static consts
initialized in-class are not marked unless they are also defined
out-of-class.

     <p>On cygwin, mingw and arm-pe targets, <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> is
recognized as a synonym for <code>__attribute__ ((dllexport))</code> for
compatibility with other Microsoft Windows compilers.

     <p>Alternative methods for including the symbol in the dll's export table
are to use a .def file with an <code>EXPORTS</code> section or, with GNU ld,
using the <code>--export-all</code> linker flag.

   </dl>

   <p>You can specify multiple attributes in a declaration by separating them
by commas within the double parentheses or by immediately following an
attribute declaration with another attribute declaration.

   <p>Some people object to the <code>__attribute__</code> feature, suggesting that
ISO C's <code>#pragma</code> should be used instead.  At the time
<code>__attribute__</code> was designed, there were two reasons for not doing
this.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>It is impossible to generate <code>#pragma</code> commands from a macro.

     <li>There is no telling what the same <code>#pragma</code> might mean in another
compiler.
        </ol>

   <p>These two reasons applied to almost any application that might have been
proposed for <code>#pragma</code>.  It was basically a mistake to use
<code>#pragma</code> for <em>anything</em>.

   <p>The ISO C99 standard includes <code>_Pragma</code>, which now allows pragmas
to be generated from macros.  In addition, a <code>#pragma GCC</code>
namespace is now in use for GCC-specific pragmas.  However, it has been
found convenient to use <code>__attribute__</code> to achieve a natural
attachment of attributes to their corresponding declarations, whereas
<code>#pragma GCC</code> is of use for constructs that do not naturally form
part of the grammar.  See <a href="../cpp/Other-Directives.html#Other%20Directives">Miscellaneous Preprocessing Directives</a>.
