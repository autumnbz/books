<h3 class="section">Deprecated Features</h3>

<p>In the past, the GNU C++ compiler was extended to experiment with new
features, at a time when the C++ language was still evolving.  Now that
the C++ standard is complete, some of those features are superseded by
superior alternatives.  Using the old features might cause a warning in
some cases that the feature will be dropped in the future.  In other
cases, the feature might be gone already.

   <p>While the list below is not exhaustive, it documents some of the options
that are now deprecated:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fexternal-templates</code>
     <dd><dt><code>-falt-external-templates</code>
     <dd>These are two of the many ways for G++ to implement template
instantiation.  See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template%20Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>.  The C++ standard clearly
defines how template definitions have to be organized across
implementation units.  G++ has an implicit instantiation mechanism that
should work just fine for standard-conforming code.

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-prototype</code>
     <dd><dt><code>-fno-strict-prototype</code>
     <dd>Previously it was possible to use an empty prototype parameter list to
indicate an unspecified number of parameters (like C), rather than no
parameters, as C++ demands.  This feature has been removed, except where
it is required for backwards compatibility See <a href="Backwards-Compatibility.html#Backwards%20Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>The named return value extension has been deprecated, and is now
removed from G++.

   <p>The use of initializer lists with new expressions has been deprecated,
and is now removed from G++.

   <p>Floating and complex non-type template parameters have been deprecated,
and are now removed from G++.

   <p>The implicit typename extension has been deprecated and is now
removed from G++.

   <p>The use of default arguments in function pointers, function typedefs and
and other places where they are not permitted by the standard is
deprecated and will be removed from a future version of G++.
