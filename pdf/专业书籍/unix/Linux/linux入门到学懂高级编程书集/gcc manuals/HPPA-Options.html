<h3 class="subsection">HPPA Options</h4>

<p>These <code>-m</code> options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-march=</code><var>architecture-type</var><code></code>
     <dd>Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
<var>architecture-type</var> are <code>1.0</code> for PA 1.0, <code>1.1</code> for PA
1.1, and <code>2.0</code> for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to
<code>/usr/lib/sched.models</code> on an HP-UX system to determine the proper
architecture option for your machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered
architectures will run on higher numbered architectures, but not the
other way around.

     <p>PA 2.0 support currently requires gas snapshot 19990413 or later.  The
next release of binutils (current is 2.9.1) will probably contain PA 2.0
support.

     <br><dt><code>-mpa-risc-1-0</code>
     <dd><dt><code>-mpa-risc-1-1</code>
     <dd><dt><code>-mpa-risc-2-0</code>
     <dd>Synonyms for <code>-march=1.0</code>, <code>-march=1.1</code>, and <code>-march=2.0</code> respectively.

     <br><dt><code>-mbig-switch</code>
     <dd>Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only if
the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches within a switch
table.

     <br><dt><code>-mjump-in-delay</code>
     <dd>Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump instructions
by modifying the return pointer for the function call to be the target
of the conditional jump.

     <br><dt><code>-mdisable-fpregs</code>
     <dd>Prevent floating point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels which perform lazy context switching of
floating point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating point operations, the compiler will abort.

     <br><dt><code>-mdisable-indexing</code>
     <dd>Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-space-regs</code>
     <dd>Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.

     <p>Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.

     <br><dt><code>-mfast-indirect-calls</code>
     <dd>Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.  This
allows GCC to emit code which performs faster indirect calls.

     <p>This option will not work in the presence of shared libraries or nested
functions.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-load-store</code>
     <dd>Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by
the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the <code>+k</code> option to
the HP compilers.

     <br><dt><code>-mportable-runtime</code>
     <dd>Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF systems.

     <br><dt><code>-mgas</code>
     <dd>Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.

     <br><dt><code>-mschedule=</code><var>cpu-type</var><code></code>
     <dd>Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
<var>cpu-type</var>.  The choices for <var>cpu-type</var> are <code>700</code>
<code>7100</code>, <code>7100LC</code>, <code>7200</code>, <code>7300</code> and <code>8000</code>.  Refer
to <code>/usr/lib/sched.models</code> on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper scheduling option for your machine.  The default scheduling is
<code>8000</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-mlinker-opt</code>
     <dd>Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.

     <br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code>
     <dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded target <code>hppa1.1-*-pro</code>
does provide software floating point support.

     <p><code>-msoft-float</code> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <code>libgcc.a</code>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <code>-msoft-float</code> in order for
this to work.

     <br><dt><code>-msio</code>
     <dd>Generate the predefine, <code>_SIO</code>, for server IO.  The default is
<code>-mwsio</code>.  This generates the predefines, <code>__hp9000s700</code>,
<code>__hp9000s700__</code> and <code>_WSIO</code>, for workstation IO.  These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.

     <br><dt><code>-mgnu-ld</code>
     <dd>Use GNU ld specific options.  This passes <code>-shared</code> to ld when
building a shared library.  It is the default when GCC is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker.  This option does not
have any affect on which ld is called, it only changes what parameters
are passed to that ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the
<code>--with-ld</code> configure option, GCC's program search path, and
finally by the user's <code>PATH</code>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed
using <code>which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-mhp-ld</code>
     <dd>Use HP ld specific options.  This passes <code>-b</code> to ld when building
a shared library and passes <code>+Accept TypeMismatch</code> to ld on all
links.  It is the default when GCC is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option does not have any affect on
which ld is called, it only changes what parameters are passed to that
ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the <code>--with-ld</code>
configure option, GCC's program search path, and finally by the user's
<code>PATH</code>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed using <code>which
`gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-mfdpic</code>
     <dd>

     <p>Select the FDPIC ABI, that uses function descriptors to represent
pointers to functions.  Without any PIC/PIE-related options, it
implies <code>-fPIE</code>.  With <code>-fpic</code> or <code>-fpie</code>, it
assumes GOT entries and small data are within a 12-bit range from the
GOT base address; with <code>-fPIC</code> or <code>-fPIE</code>, GOT offsets
are computed with 32 bits.

     <br><dt><code>-minline-plt</code>
     <dd>

     <p>Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that are
not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without <code>-mfdpic</code>. 
It's enabled by default if optimizing for speed and compiling for
shared libraries (i.e., <code>-fPIC</code> or <code>-fpic</code>), or when an
optimization option such as <code>-O3</code> or above is present in the
command line.

     <br><dt><code>-mgprel-ro</code>
     <dd>

     <p>Enable the use of <code>GPREL</code> relocations in the FDPIC ABI for data
that is known to be in read-only sections.  It's enabled by default,
except for <code>-fpic</code> or <code>-fpie</code>: even though it may help
make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for 4. 
With <code>-fPIC</code> or <code>-fPIE</code>, it trades 3 instructions for 4,
one of which may be shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need
for a GOT entry for the referenced symbol, so it's more likely to be a
win.  If it is not, <code>-mno-gprel-ro</code> can be used to disable it.

     <br><dt><code>-multilib-library-pic</code>
     <dd>

     <p>Link with the (library, not FD) pic libraries.  It's implied by
<code>-mlibrary-pic</code>, as well as by <code>-fPIC</code> and
<code>-fpic</code> without <code>-mfdpic</code>.  You should never have to use
it explicitly.

     <br><dt><code>-mlinked-fp</code>
     <dd>

     <p>Follow the EABI requirement of always creating a frame pointer whenever
a stack frame is allocated.  This option is enabled by default and can
be disabled with <code>-mno-linked-fp</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-calls</code>
     <dd>Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.

     <p>Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
<code>-ffunction-sections</code> option, or when using the <code>-mgas</code>
and <code>-mno-portable-runtime</code> options together under HP-UX with
the SOM linker.

     <p>It is normally not desirable to use this option as it will degrade
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.

     <p>The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small. 
However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code
and it is quite long.

     <br><dt><code>-nolibdld</code>
     <dd>Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
<code>-static</code> option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.

     <br><dt><code>-static</code>
     <dd>The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the <code>-static</code> option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.

     <p>On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the <code>-static</code> option is specified. 
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
<code>-nolibdld</code> option can be used to prevent the GCC driver from
adding these link options.

     <br><dt><code>-threads</code>
     <dd>Add support for multithreading with the <dfn>dce thread</dfn> library
under HP-UX.  This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and
linker.
