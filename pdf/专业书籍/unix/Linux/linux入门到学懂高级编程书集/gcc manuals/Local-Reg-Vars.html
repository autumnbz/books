<h3 class="subsection">Specifying Registers for Local Variables</h4>

<p>You can define a local register variable with a specified register
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     register int *foo asm ("a5");
     </pre>

<p>Here <code>a5</code> is the name of the register which should be used.  Note
that this is the same syntax used for defining global register
variables, but for a local variable it would appear within a function.

   <p>Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, but this is not a
problem, since specific registers are most often useful with explicit
assembler instructions (see <a href="Extended-Asm.html#Extended%20Asm">Extended Asm</a>).  Both of these things
generally require that you conditionalize your program according to
cpu type.

   <p>In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <code>%a5</code>.

   <p>Defining such a register variable does not reserve the register; it
remains available for other uses in places where flow control determines
the variable's value is not live.

   <p>This option does not guarantee that GCC will generate code that has
this variable in the register you specify at all times.  You may not
code an explicit reference to this register in an <code>asm</code> statement
and assume it will always refer to this variable.

   <p>Stores into local register variables may be deleted when they appear to be dead
according to dataflow analysis.  References to local register variables may
be deleted or moved or simplified.
