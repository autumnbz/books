<h3 class="subsection">Implicit Copy-Assignment for Virtual Bases</h4>

<p>When a base class is virtual, only one subobject of the base class
belongs to each full object.  Also, the constructors and destructors are
invoked only once, and called from the most-derived class.  However, such
objects behave unspecified when being assigned.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct Base{
       char *name;
       Base(char *n) : name(strdup(n)){}
       Base&amp; operator= (const Base&amp; other){
        free (name);
        name = strdup (other.name);
       }
     };
     
     struct A:virtual Base{
       int val;
       A():Base("A"){}
     };
     
     struct B:virtual Base{
       int bval;
       B():Base("B"){}
     };
     
     struct Derived:public A, public B{
       Derived():Base("Derived"){}
     };
     
     void func(Derived &amp;d1, Derived &amp;d2)
     {
       d1 = d2;
     }
     </pre>

   <p>The C++ standard specifies that <code>Base::Base</code> is only called once
when constructing or copy-constructing a Derived object.  It is
unspecified whether <code>Base::operator=</code> is called more than once when
the implicit copy-assignment for Derived objects is invoked (as it is
inside <code>func</code> in the example).

   <p>G++ implements the "intuitive" algorithm for copy-assignment: assign all
direct bases, then assign all members.  In that algorithm, the virtual
base subobject can be encountered more than once.  In the example, copying
proceeds in the following order: <code>val</code>, <code>name</code> (via
<code>strdup</code>), <code>bval</code>, and <code>name</code> again.

   <p>If application code relies on copy-assignment, a user-defined
copy-assignment operator removes any uncertainties.  With such an
operator, the application can define whether and how the virtual base
subobject is assigned.
